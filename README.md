- Need testing_lang, visualization, pyethereum, viper


## TODOS

- show error messages
- speed it up? currently reruns blockchain for every change in test string
- mobile friendly
- lfe and lje edges look like butts ;_;
- not realtime like viz.js yet bc updating runs blockchain from the very beginning each time so added update button so multiple requests aren't sent on each small change
